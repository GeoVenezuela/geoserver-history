imageio-ext-tiff and imageio-ext-imagereadmt modules are SUN's JAI-ImageIO derivative work and are therefore released under Custom, BSD style. See belove.

Our derivative work from jai-imageio classes is released as BSD instead of LGPL so that it should be much easier to push it back to imageio later on.

The it/geosolutions/imageio/imageioimpl/imagereadmt package contains a specific ImageRead operation implementation with support for multithreading. 
The it/geosolutions/imageio/plugins/tiff/
 and 
it/geosolutions/imageioimpl/plugins/tiff/ packages contain an improved version of the SUN's JAI ImageIO TIFF plugin 
for Double datatypes management.

These classes can be considered derivative work from JAI ImageIO classes, 
hence we also retain the underlying copyright which brings in an additional limitation as follows:
 " You acknowledge that this software is not designed or intended for 
   use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any 
   nuclear facility. "
