<p>Provides for connection to all data storage formats.</p>

<p>Each subdirectory contains a group of classes that facilitate 
connection to a specific data store.&nbsp; Note that the name <code>db</code> is used as 
convenient shorthand for any type of data storage format; it does not imply that 
all data storage formats must be relational databases.&nbsp; In fact, several 
planned data stores are simply flat files.</p>

<p>The interfaces defined at the top level of <code>db</code> must be implemented by format 
specific sub-packages.&nbsp; All interfaces defined at the top level represent
<i>Web Feature Server</i> responses that require information from the data store 
itself.&nbsp; The naming convention for each implementing class is the 
sub-package name followed by the interface name.&nbsp; For example, the PostGIS 
implementation of <code>GetFeature</code> is called <code>PostgisGetFeature</code> in the <code>db.jdbc</code> 
subdirectory.&nbsp; It is also recommended that format specific sub-packages subclass the the GML 
geographic types defined in <code>db</code>.&nbsp; The naming convention for each 
implementing subclass is the sub-package name followed by the geographic type 
name.&nbsp; For example, the PostGIS implementation of <code>GMLPoint</code> is called 
<code>PostgisPoint</code>.&nbsp; Furthermore, the sub-package must subclass the <code>GetFeatureGML</code> 
class, naming it using the sub-package name, followed by 'GML.'&nbsp; For 
example, the PostGIS-specific class is called <code>PostgisGML</code>.&nbsp; Sub-packages may 
also contain any number of other classes, useful to data extraction, insertion, 
and manipulation.&nbsp; To summarize, requirements for sub-packages are as 
follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Must implement all <code>db</code> package interfaces.</li>
  <li>Should subclass all <code>db</code> package GML geographic types.</li>
  <li>Must subclass the <code>GetFeatureGML</code> class.</li>
  <li>May include any other useful classes.</li>
</ol>
