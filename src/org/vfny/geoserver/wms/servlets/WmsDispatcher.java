/**
 * Routes requests made at the top-level URI to appropriate interface servlet.
 * Note that the logic of this method could be generously described as
 * 'loose.' It is not checking for request validity in any way (this is done
 * by the reqeust- specific servlets).  Rather, it is attempting to make a
 * reasonable guess as to what servlet to call, given that the client is
 * routing to the top level URI as opposed to the request-specific URI, as
 * specified in the GetCapabilities response. Thus, this is a convenience
 * method, which allows for some slight client laziness and helps explain to
 * lost souls/spiders what lives at the URL. Due to the string parsing, it is
 * much faster (and recommended) to use the URIs specified in the
 * GetCapabablities response.  Currently does not support post requests, but
 * most requests for this will likely come with get.
