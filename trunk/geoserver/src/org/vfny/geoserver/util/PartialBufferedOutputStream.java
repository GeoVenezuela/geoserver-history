/**
 * <b>PartialBufferedOutputStream</b><br>
 * Oct 19, 2005<br>
 * 
 * <b>Purpose:</b><br>
 * I have modelled this class after the BufferedOutputStream. Several methods are
 * synchronized as a result. The interior of this class uses a ByteArrayOutputStream 
 * when it starts and then a BufferedOutputStream. This is essentially a decorator.
 * 
 * This class uses a temporary to-memory OutputStream for initial bufferring. This 
 * OutputStream is a ByteArrayOutputStream. Once a pre-defined BUFFER_SIZE has been 
 * reached, the output that is stored in the ByteArrayOutputStream is output to the 
 * real OutputStream to the response. Further data is then written to that response 
 * OutputStream.
 * 
 * For the first run of this, we will write to memory for the buffered part. Writing to 
 * disk is another option.
 * NOTE: If we switch to writing out to disk, we will have to clean up our temporary 
 * files with abort().
 * 
 * WARNING: IF you abuse the size of the buffer, you may leak memory if this OutputStream 
 * is not terminated. The ByteArrayOutputStream will hold onto its allocated memory even after 
 * you call reset() on it. So if you put in 60MB of buffer space, it will stay there until 
 * the object is no longer referenced and the garbage collector decides to pick it up. A
 * solution to this would be to use a FileOutputStream instead of the ByteArrayOutputStream.
 * 
 * CONTRACT:
 * -close() will NOT flush remaining bytes to the output stream, as per the contract 
 * with OutputStream. Close will remove any references to OutputStreams and its 
 * HttpServletResponse.
 * -flush() will flush the buffer first and then any information stored in the underlying 
 * OutputStream. Everything will be flushed when flush is called.
 * -abort() will succeed if the buffer is not full yet. If the buffer has been filled and
 * the information has been written out to response's OutputStream, the abort reports as
 * having failed. The point of this PartialBufferedOutputStream is to allow an abort before 
 * the information has been written out to the real OutputStream. When abort is called the
 * references to any OutputStreams and the HttpServletResponse are removed.
