    <!-- Sets the global character set.  This could use some more testing
          from international users, but what it does is sets the encoding
          globally for all postgis database connections (the charset tag
          in FeatureType), as well as specifying the encoding in the return
          xml header and mime type.  The default is UTF-8.  Also be warned
          that GeoServer does not check if the CharSet is valid before
          attempting to use it, so it will fail miserably if a bad charset
          is used.

     <!-- Define a base url for the location of the wfs schemas.
          By default GeoServer loads and references its own at
          <URL>/data/capabilities. Uncomment to enable.  The
          standalone Tomcat server needs SchemaBaseUrl defined
          for validation.
