  <title>How to Help</title>

  <para>GeoServer fully embraces an open source development model that does
  not see a split between user and developer, producer and consumer, but
  instead sees everyone as a valuable resource in a collaborative quest to
  build something better than any of us could alone. The amount of effort that
  has been contributed already has been incredible, and in many ways we feel
  we are just getting started. To help that effort we ask that you do not see
  yourself simply as a user of the software, but instead try to find a way to
  give something back. This certainly does not have to be as a developer, it
  can be as simple as suggesting a feature or improvement, reporting a
  problem, or letting others know about GeoServer. These may seem like very
  minor things, but commercial software companies pay large amounts of money
  for these things, but they call them Market Research, Quality Assurance and
  Advertising. Every little thing helps to make GeoServer a better project,
  and while there are a few core developers, the software would not be nearly
  as advanced as it is today without a community of people testing, making
  suggestions and spreading the word. You can even help out by just offering
  words of encouragement to those working on the project, as many developers
  do not do this for the money, but do it for personal creativity and for the
  feeling of building something that others really appreciate. Adding yourself
  to the <ulink
  url="http://www.moximedia.com:8080/imf-ows/imf.jsp?site=gs_users">user
  map</ulink> is a great way to let us know that you value the work
  done.</para>

  <para>One last word about contributing, before we go into all the different
  ways that you can help out, is to do it because you want to. Find a task
  that really interests you, that you feel good about doing, or that forces
  you to learn something new. We are excited about working on GeoServer, and
  hope that the quality of the project is a testament to that. We believe the
  first step in changing the world is to love what you do on a day to day
  basis; that if you do not enjoy your work then what you create in the world
  will reflect that. We do hope that you will come to love working on
  GeoServer, and will find ways to contribute ever more. But if it makes you
  unhappy, if you are using or contributing to GeoServer out of an unwanted
  obligation, then we very much encourage you to change your life to find (or
  at least try to find) something that you do love.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Documentation</title>

    <para>One of the best ways to help out is with documentation, a task most
    developer's loathe. We very much believe in the importance of documenting
    as much as possible, but having our core community be developers means we
    are often late in fully documenting everything. So lately we have tried to
    lower the barrier to entry to write documentation, by starting the <ulink
    url="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/Home">GeoServer Wiki</ulink>.
    The site is editable by anyone, with an incredibly simple mark up language
    that takes about 2 minutes to learn. Please add or modify any information
    there. It currently could use a nice re-organization, which we hope to
    start relatively soon. Please feel free to not limit yourself to adding
    straight documentation, we really welcome most any information that might
    be relevant to other users. This could be howtos on getting GeoServer
    working with various clients (link to client section), or background
    explanations of OGC specs that you had to look up and would have found
    useful, or even how GeoServer compares to other WMS/WFSes out there. We
    believe in having as much open information as possible. Eventually we hope
    to contribute various portions of our wiki that are more general than just
    GeoServer to wider projects, such as the wiki based Open Source GIS book
    we are collaborating on. So for now just put that information on the
    GeoServer wiki, so it is available somewhere, and we will figure out
    exactly where it should go later. We would very much like the wiki to be a
    vast repository of information, of all things GeoServer related. If you
    are interested in becoming involved in GeoServer, but lack the coding
    skills, then leading the GeoServer documentation would be a great way to
    join. Eventually we are hoping to move even the user and developers docs
    to wiki (as soon as we can figure out good internationalization and how to
    work offline). To use the wiki you will have to sign up for an account.
    This is just so that we can recognize who posted what to the wiki. (we
    will try to get a good tutorial on using the wiki soon)</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Email and JIRA assistance</title>

    <para>Related to documentation is helping out on the email lists. We would
    really like a self supporting users list, and you can become an expert on
    using GeoServer by thoroughly reading the documentation, reading the list
    archives, and being on the lists for awhile. But even if you can’t answer
    the questions yourself, it is a great help to direct things where
    appropriate. Send bugs to the JIRA task tracker, ask the devel list, and
    point to the documentation. And perhaps the best thing to do is to work to
    close the gap between the email lists and the documentation. The ideal
    would be if every question asked and answered on the email lists were then
    turned into documentation. If someone asks a questions once it is fairly
    likely that someone else has the same question. It would be great if
    someone could build a really comprehensive FAQ, answering common questions
    and pointing to other points in the documentation.</para>

    <para>You can also help us keep the JIRA task tracker organized. We tend
    to not get too many duplicate bugs, as most people do not yet report
    directly to the tracker whenever they have a problem, but eliminating
    those would be great. And then also scheduling what bugs should be fixed
    for what releases. Most people submit them without a fix version number,
    it's actually a great help just to schedule the bugs for the next minor
    release, and the requested issues for the next major release.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Translation</title>

    <para>Another great way to help out is translation. We would like
    GeoServer available in as many languages as possible, as we want world
    wide data to be available to all. The first thing to translate is the web
    administration tool, which can be easily translated to most any language
    by making a new ApplicationsResources file. The second way is by
    translating this documentation. For further information on how to
    translate GeoServer please see the <ulink
    url="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/How+to+Internationalize+GeoServer">internationalization
    page</ulink> on the <ulink
    url="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS">GeoServer wiki</ulink>.
    Eventually we would even like to set up GeoServer community sites in
    different languages, if you are interested in this please let us
    know.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Reporting Bugs</title>

    <para>If you have a problem when working with GeoServer, then please,
    please let us know, we can only fix problems if we know about them. To
    report a bug please use our <ulink
    url="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311">JIRA
    task tracker</ulink>. See the communcation section in the <ulink
    url="user_intro.html">user introduction</ulink> for information on the
    task tracker. If possible you should try to see if your bug has been
    reported, by searching, but you need not spend a ton of time doing that,
    as the developers can easily recognize duplicates and mark them as such.
    To help us fix the bug as quickly as possible (and so we don’t have to
    email you a ton of questions), please include as much information as
    possible about the bug. After you select the type of issue (most likely
    bug, but please feel free to report ‘wishes’ or ‘new features’ that you
    would like to see in GeoServer), then you will be lead to a page of
    several fields. Please try to fill out as many as possible. The version of
    GeoServer you are using is essential. For the fix version you can put the
    next logical version of GeoServer, if developers need to reschedule it
    they will. Please put as much information in the environment field as you
    can. If your GeoServer version is a binary, source, or war install. If it
    is a war install then put the servlet container type and version. Include
    your version of Java (found by typing ‘java –version’ at the command
    line), your operating system and its version, and the backend datastore
    you are using (oracle, postgis, ect.) as well as its version. </para>

    <para>Then describe the issue in as much depth as possible. If the error
    is in a request made to GeoServer (as opposed to in the web admin tool),
    then we ask that you change the Verbose Exceptions property to true. Login
    to the admin tool andgo to Config -&gt; Server, and you should see a
    checkbox. Make sure that it is checked, and you can also use this
    opportunity to adjust the logging level. A FINE or FINER is general
    appropriate for a bug report. After adjusting the server configuration be
    sure to hit submit and then apply. Then try the error again, and you
    should see a lot more information from GeoServer. Copy down this response,
    and include both the request and the response. This large error, which
    should have a bunch of java line numbers, is probably the most important
    part of a good bug report. If the error is in the web admin tool then try
    to replicate the error, and write down the exact path that lead you to the
    error. The other very helpful piece of information is the logs from
    GeoServer. In the binary installation these go to the console, in the war
    installation it depends on the servlet container (tomcat puts it in
    $CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out). </para>

    <para>Before reporting the bug please check the relevant specifications to
    make sure that you are making the correct request, though if you include
    it we should be able to quickly tell if the request is right. Remember to
    include namespace declarations in your request, as GeoServer will not
    function correctly unless they are there. If it is an error with
    configuration then the service.xml and catalog.xml files may be useful
    (found in server/geoserver/WEB-INF/), as well as the info.xml file (and
    schema.xml if there is one) for the featureType that is messing up (found
    in server/geoserver/data/featureTypes/(featureType name)/. If the backend
    data format is messing up then try to include the data, either the
    shapefile or perhaps a dump of the database. Note that you can attach
    files directly to an issue, which we highly recommend for larger files.
    When you submit a bug it will be sent to the devel list, and developers
    will respond appropriately. JIRA will notify you of progress and when it
    is resolved. When it is sent to the devel list other interested parties
    can also subscribe to get notifications of the bug by hitting the ‘watch’
    button.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Suggestions for Improvement</title>

    <para>If you have suggestions as to how we can make GeoServer better, we
    would love to hear them. Even if we are already planning on implementing a
    feature that you would like it does not hurt to hear from you, as we will
    likely move it up the priority list a bit. We usually have a poll on the
    GeoServer homepage on what feature you would like to see us implement
    next. It is generally features we are planning on hitting relatively soon,
    and we definitely take the results of the poll into account for the order
    in which we do them. Coming features and improvements are also tracked in
    our JIRA task tracker. They are scheduled there according to the GeoServer
    version they will be implemented in. We are also working on constructing a
    broad roadmap and vision for the future direction of GeoServer, and we
    would love feedback and input on where you would like to see the project
    go. Please check the wiki for the latest, and comment or add to it. And if
    you do evaluate GeoServer and decide that it is not for you, please let us
    know why you did not end up choosing it, what features were lacking, and
    we will do our best to implement them in the future.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Spread the word</title>

    <para>A further way to really help out the GeoServer project is to spread
    the word about it. This may seem like a minor thing, but as we said
    earlier, commercial companies pay big money for marketing to sell their
    products. But the marketing they can’t buy is the word of mouth grassroots
    information sharing about good software. So at the very least you can
    email a few co-workers and friends who might be interested. If you are on
    any lists of people who might be interested then you could email them. And
    you could also blog about it, put it in directories, and even write an
    article. But let people know, because it directly benefits you, since the
    wider the circle of users is the more potential contributors there
    are.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Development</title>

    <para>If you are a software developer then that is of course the obvious
    way to help out, to write code to improve GeoServer. Generally developers
    start with bug fixes and small patches, and then move into larger
    contributions as they learn the system. Even if you don’t know Java, or do
    not really know computer programmer, we do encourage you to try to look at
    the code and figure out what is going on. That is the whole beauty of open
    source, you can open up the hood of the car and see how it is running. You
    can start as a user and slowly educate yourself on how it all works. Our
    developers are more than happy to help out as you learn and get
    acquainted, and we try our hardest to keep our code clean and well
    documented. For further information about developing with GeoServer please
    see the <ulink url="../developer/dev_intro.html">developers
    documentation</ulink>, as we spent a lot of time on those docs so it is
    easy for developers to contribute.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Help fund GeoServer improvements</title>

    <para>A final way to help out is to push for GeoServer to be used more in
    your own organization. There may be some capabilities that GeoServer is
    lacking compared to commercial solutions, but we would like to point out
    that it may be more cost effective to employ developers to work directly
    on the capability you need than to merely pay for the right to use some
    one else's software. Any improvements made on GeoServer go to the benefit
    of all, not just those who can afford expensive software. Funding that
    initial improvement can also lead to a snowball effect, as there are
    likely other organizations who would be much closer to using and further
    supporting GeoServer if it was closer to meeting their requirements. A
    number of different organizations can form the next step in improving
    GeoServer, so that in funding for one improvement you will start the ball
    rolling for many, many more improvements. We have little doubt that the
    collaborative open source model can easily lead to GeoServer becoming an
    Apache type project, being simply the best in its category, open source or
    commercial. And if there is concern over the quality of support available
    from an Open Source project please see the section on Commercial Support
    in the <ulink url="user_intro.html">user introduction</ulink>. Also note
    that you are more than welcome to use in house developers or your favorite
    software company to perform improvements on GeoServer, we just ask that
    they roll their improvements back in to the code base. If you need help
    finding good developers we can easily assist, just email <ulink
    url="???">geoserver@openplans.org</ulink>. We are building a network of
    consulting companies and government agencies in different countries who
    can all make incremental improvements on GeoServer.</para>
