    <title>Welcome</title>

    <para>First, we'd like to welcome you to the GeoServer community. 'Who
    me?', you may be saying, 'I didn't sign up for any community, I just want
    some software'. Well simply by being interested in sharing your spatial
    data with others, we feel you are a part of what we are hoping to
    accomplish, and welcome you. We believe that the open sharing of
    information, and especially spatial data, is essential to tackle many of
    the problems of the world. GeoServer aspires to be the <ulink
    url="http://www.apache.org">Apache</ulink> of spatial data sharing, by
    providing an open source, freely available implementation of the <ulink
    url="http://www.opengis.org">OpenGIS Consortium's</ulink> (OGC) Web
    Feature Service (WFS) and Web Map Service (WMS) specifications. We hope to
    enable greater geographic interoperability by enforcing OGC standards and
    lowering the barriers to entry for geographic data providers interested in
    sharing their data. Even if you evaluate GeoServer and decide that another
    product suits your needs better, then by all means use it, we don't
    pretend that our software will meet every use (though we encourage you to
    help it do so). But if you do, please use one that fully implements OGC
    standards. The GeoServer Project itself strives to be as open as possible,
    making it easy for any one to contribute, be it with feature suggestions,
    bug reports, patches, documentation, encouragement, funding, development,
    design, translation, or more. We want GeoServer to be collaboratively
    built, so that it can effectively meet a variety of needs, hopefully
    leading to a world of more open technology and open spatial data. To that
    end we ask that if you do find the software useful you try to find a way
    to give back, as good users are our most valuable resource. See the
    contributing section (how to help section? Link) for more on this, but we
    would like to dispel the notion right here that it is only through writing
    code that you can contribute. There are many, many ways that you can help
    us build a better geographic data server, and some of them only take a
    couple of minutes. If you have had enough of our blathering at this point
    and just want to get started you can skip to the installation section (or
    the quickstart section, but if you're really impatient you've probably
    already done that). For more about the history, philosophies, and future
    (link all of these) of the GeoServer Project please read on. </para>

    <para>&lt;cut&gt;GeoServer has an active user community that you can
    engage by joining the GeoServer <ulink
    url="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=25086">mailing list</ulink>
    and asking questions or making suggestions.If you create a user account at
    this site, you may participate in forums and vote in polls as well. We
    also strongly encourage you to submit bugs and improvements you would like
    to see to our , as the only way we can improve GeoServer is with your
    feedback. You will have to create an account to use it, but your email
    address will not be used except to notify you when your issue is worked on
    &lt;/cut&gt;.</para>

    <title>History</title>

    <para>GeoServer was started by <ulink url="http://www.openplans.org">The
    Open Planning Project </ulink>(TOPP), a small non-profit in New York,
    looking to make urban planning decisions more open to the citizens they
    affect. TOPP hopes to make a whole suite of tools to enable open democracy
    and to help make government more transparent. These tools themselves must
    be transparent and modifiable, so that they do not surreptitiously put
    forth an agenda, And they must be freely available, so that all can truly
    participate, not just those who can afford to spend money on software. For
    this reason all tools in the suite must be open source and free. The first
    of these was GeoServer, which came out of a recognition that a suite of
    tools to enable citizen involvement in urban planning would be for naught
    if they could not access any spatial data. The GeoServer Project envisions
    a spatial data web, just like the internet, where you can search for and
    download text data, you could simply search and browse the spatial data
    web. Data providers would be able to publish their data straight to this
    web, and users could directly access it, without having to specifically
    know who might provide the data they want, contact them in some way, get
    emailed (or sent, or pointed to a web location) some file, convert the
    file to a format they could work in, and then actually get started on the
    task they really want to do. At the time GeoServer was starting the
    OpenGIS Consortium was working on the Web Feature Service standard. It
    specifies a protocol to make spatial data directly available on the web,
    using GML (Geographic Markup Language), an interoperable data format.
    Happily <ulink url="http://www.refractions.net">Refractions
    Research</ulink> had started work on <ulink
    url="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</ulink>, giving GeoServer an
    open source spatial database to run on top of. After wrestling with the
    fact that an internal model of geographic features was needed, and not
    wanting to replicate a ton of work, GeoServer found the <ulink
    url="http://www.geotools.org">GeoTools</ulink> project, an open source GIS
    Java toolkit. Both projects have benefited immensely from this
    collaboration as we helped develop much of their model further, and
    GeoTools code turned into direct GeoServer contributions, including
    support for Shapefiles, Oracle, and ArcSDE, as well as the WMS that is now
    an integrated part of GeoServer. In 2003 GeoServer made its way to 1.0 as
    part of the OGC’s <ulink
    url="http://cite.occamlab.com/tsOGC/">CITE</ulink> project, where we
    helped develop a conformance testing suite and were named the WFS
    reference implementation. Then we went back to the drawing board in order
    to build a much more scalable GeoServer, helping GeoTools redo their
    feature and data models. Refractions Research secured a GeoConnections
    grant from the Canadian government to develop GeoServer much further, and
    got immediately involved in the GeoTools data refactoring. Gabriel Roldan,
    who recently started <ulink url="http://axios.es">Axios
    Engineering</ulink> to do further work on GeoServer, helped rearchitect
    GeoServer to integrate GeoTools WMS, bringing us to 1.1. Then Jody Garnett
    and his team at Refractions really went to work, adding an innovative
    validation system to allow users to ensure that incoming transactions
    followed their defined rules. They also did the great STRUTS based web
    administration tool, so that users need never look at configuration files,
    taking us to 1.2. And through it all many, many contributions and
    suggestions by our users have played a huge roll in making GeoServer what
    it is today.</para>

    <title>Philosophy</title>

    <para>The history of GeoServer should highlight a core belief of the
    project – that through cooperation we can build something greater than any
    of us could alone. We take the full open source development model
    extremely seriously, far beyond just the license, we believe in creating a
    community working together to build GeoServer. A good representation of
    this philosophy can be found in Eric Raymond’s The Cathedral and the
    Bazaar (link). GeoServer accepts most all contributions, even uses far
    from our core mission, and allows any one to build upon on the code. We
    treat our users as co-developers, as they are our most valuable resource.
    And we believe that a number of different companies, governments, NGO’s,
    universities and R+D groups can all use and contribute to GeoServer for
    their own ends, making the software much better for all. This is already
    very much happening, as the major fundings for GeoServer have come from
    very diverse sources. We are working on some documents to show exactly how
    each can use and further build GeoServer together (check the wiki), but
    for now we just want to emphasize that the decision structure for the
    project is extremely open. It is a complete meritocracy, and anyone can
    influence the direction. TOPP is committed to employing someone to focus
    on keeping GeoServer moving, doing the day to day work of keeping the
    community going, but is ultimately working towards a complete self
    sustaining community. TOPP holds the copyright, but just sees itself as a
    steward for an emerging community, as the license is GPL, and will
    transfer to a Project Management Committee (PMC) like GeoTools has, when
    appropriate. But even if you do not become a major contributor, you still
    very much have a say on the direction of GeoServer, and there are many,
    many smaller ways in which you can contribute. The other way that this
    core belief manifests itself is that we leverage as much already exisiting
    work as possible, and strive to work with other open source projects as
    much as possible. We’ve had varying success with this over the years, from
    GeoTools where we both have benefitted incredibly from close
    collaboration, to attempts to join up with other projects that were not
    quite as successful. But we believe strongly that the extra up front
    effort to just set up a collaboration pays off handsomely, as working with
    GeoTools has proven. So please get in touch if you are interested in
    collaboration. Oftentimes it won’t make sense to work directly with
    GeoServer, but working together at the GeoTools level can gain us almost
    all the benefits of direct collaboration, as each project’s efforts will
    feed the others. If you are working in another language then we encourage
    you to use the open OGC interfaces, and to test against GeoServer to make
    sure interoperability is actually achieved (and please report any bugs on
    the GeoServer end!). Beyond direct collaboration, we also make use of as
    many other open source projects as possible. GeoServer would simply not be
    possible without Jetty, PostGIS, Postgresql, Tomcat, Ant, STRUTS, xerces,
    wkb4j, and more (links). One of the greatest thing about open source is
    that we do not need to replicate work, we can just leverage the great work
    of others. </para>

    <title>Communication</title>

    <para>The two primary points of communication for the GeoServer project
    are the email lists and our JIRA <ulink
    url="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311">task
    tracker</ulink>.</para>

    <para>There are currently two email lists,
    <email>geoserver-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email> and
    <email>geoserver-users@lists.sourceforge.net</email>. You may use either
    list, we started the user list for people who are not interested in all
    the development issues. We would like for the users list to be self
    supporting, so that experienced users can help out the newer people. The
    developers list gets a lot more email, which is partly historical, as it
    is the older list, and many people joined it before the users list was
    active. It also gets updates from the JIRA task tracker. The
    subscribe/unscribe interface and the archives for the lists are available
    <ulink url="???">here</ulink>. One thing we definitely want to emphasize
    is to use the list for most all communication, try not to email individual
    developers. And be warned that if you do email individual developers they
    are likely to cc the list (unless you explicitly ask them not to). This is
    part of our belief in open collaboration - there are likely other people
    who have the same questions, and they would like to be able to at least
    read the archives and attempt to find the answer.</para>

    <para>The second primary communication point is the task tracker. It keeps
    track of all bugs, feature requests, tasks, and issues, ensuring that the
    developers remember what needs to be done. It is available <ulink
    url="???">here</ulink>. We recommend putting all feature requests and bug
    reports directly to it. Once an issue is created an email is sent to the
    devel list, where we can take action on it. To use the tracker you will
    have to create an account and log in. We promise this is the hardest part
    of figuring out the task tracker. And it does have a purpose, as after you
    have an account JIRA will notify you whenever any modifications have been
    made to the issue you reported. To create an account click on log in
    (link, redo this)… After you are logged in you should go back to the
    GeoServer project (link), and then there should appear a link to ‘report
    issue’ (again, check this). </para>

    <title>Commercial Support</title>

    <para>One large myth about Open Source projects that we would like to
    dispel is the idea that you can’t get high quality support. The general
    open source way of finding support is to fully read the documentation,
    read all the FAQ’s, and then jump on irc, or post to lists or newsgroups.
    Most of the time you will actually get a faster and more helpful response
    than from a normal commercial support center. Your questions will actually
    be answered by the developers who write the software and users who may
    have encountered similar problems. But there is a common misperception
    about open source software, which is that the responses from lists is all
    can you get, and if people don’t bother to answer your question then there
    is no way to get additional support. That is far from the case, as there
    are a number of companies willing to provide commercial grades support,
    but at commercial prices. Refractions Research is foremost among these,
    they have made great contributions to GeoServer, and thus know the
    software quite well. See their <ulink
    url="http://www.refractions.net/geoserver">GeoServer support page</ulink>
    for more information. They can assist directly with installations,
    configurations, customizations, and telephone support. And as more
    companies are contributing to GeoServer we are slowly building a network
    in many countries that can offer local, customized support on GeoServer.
    This model is actually much better than the normal commercial model, since
    you pay directly for what you get. You don’t get support as a side effect
    of buying an expensive software license (though often you have to pay far
    more for support even if you have the license), instead you get to use the
    software for free, and get access to the lists of developers, and only if
    that is not sufficient then you can pay for support. Or you can retain a
    company for prompt support whenever you need it. Note that this situation
    is the case for most any successful open source project, there are most
    always companies that will provide most any level of support for you, if
    you are willing for free. Just because you can get lots of support for
    free does not mean that you can’t get even more, if you pay a little
    money. </para>
