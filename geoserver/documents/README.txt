GeoServer 1.2.0-rc2 README file
---------------------------

The 1.2.0-rc3 release is the pre-release for 1.2.0.  Please download 
and test, as we are going forth with 1.2.0 in a few days and would 
like to know of any show stoppers.  Most of the work from rc2 -> rc3
has been on passing the cite tests with postgis once again, and debugging
oracle and arcsde.  And we also got a nice GetFeatureInfo contribution
for the WMS.  The documentation for this release can be built with the 
ant document target, and will be online for 1.2.0.  The struts based web 
interface tool is available at http://localhost:8080/geoserver/.


Supporting GeoServer
--------------------
If you like GeoServer and are using it, we ask you to kindly add yourself to our
user map at http://www.moximedia.com:8080/imf-ows/imf.jsp?site=gs_users  Doing
so helps ensure our continued funding, as our primary funder wants to know that
people are actually using the project.  The map also serves as a demonstration
of GeoServer as it is built using GeoServer for the queries and MapServer to
display.

Bugs
----------

We're feeling about ready for 1.2.0, so _please_ let us know about any 
show stopping bugs you might experience.  Please make use of our JIRA 
task tracker http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311
or email geoserver-devel@lists.sf.net
