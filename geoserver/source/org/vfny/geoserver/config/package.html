<p>Manages all of the administrative and configuration issues for the server.</p>
<p>This includes internal versioning information, server-wide configuration 
information, and internal tracking of the served feature types.&nbsp; Wherever 
possible, configuration information is abstracted into JavaBeans, which reside 
at the top level of the&nbsp;<code>config</code> directory. </p>
<p>All persistent configuration information is stored in XML files local to the 
server installation.&nbsp; 
These XML files are read by the groups of classes in <i>config</i> 
subdirectories, with use Castor to marshal and unmarshal the XML files into Java 
objects.&nbsp; These Java objects are then wrapped in the JavaBeans, which 
abstract the configuration information into useful categories for the server.</p>
