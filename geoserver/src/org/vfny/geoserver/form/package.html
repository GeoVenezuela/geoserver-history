    Contains FormBeans for the STRUTS framework.

    <p>
    FormBeans should be derived from ActionForm. FormBeans are used to
    communicate the state of the view to/from the Model. They hold
    the validate method which should do some basic sanity checks.
    Actually testing that the model works should be left to the config
    package.
