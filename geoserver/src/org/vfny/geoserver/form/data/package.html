    <p>
    Contains Form Beans describing the GeoServer Data Model.
    </p>
   
    <p>
    FormBeans should be derived from ActionForm. FormBeans are used to
    communicate the state of the view to/from the Model. They hold
    the validate method which should do some basic sanity checks.
    Actually testing that the model works should be left to the config
    package.
    </p>

	<p>
	As a temporary hack, due to our experience with STRUTS we have taken
	to providing configuration model query opperations as part of our
	FormBeans. This is <b>really<b> very wrong!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Don't follow this example - we just have not yet found how to query
	other parts of the system from jsp. The FormBeans are magically included
	and we have a deadline :-(
