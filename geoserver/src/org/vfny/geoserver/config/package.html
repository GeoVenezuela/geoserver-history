Configuration Model being edited.

<p>
This class opperates as the Configuration Model and is stored in Web Container.
</p>
Details:
<ul>
<li>
Represents the Model of the STRUTS based Model-View-Controller Design
</li>
<li>
Will support additional user-interface state, beyond requirements of the
GeoServer application.
</li>
<li>
Makes use of GeoTools2 Catalog/DataStore for FeatureType type names and
FeatureType schema information/generation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is tempting to replace a lot of these classes by changing the scope of the
FormBeans to session, rather than request. I cannot convince my self that this
would be a good idea, as storing the configuration model (and associated
resources in the Web Container) is sure to prevent duplication in the face
of multiple users configuring differnt subsystems. If the state was limited
to session - they would manage to overwrite each other with no prior warning.
