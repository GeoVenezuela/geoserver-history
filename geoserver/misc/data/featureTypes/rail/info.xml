                     wrong.  Run 'select postgis_version(), and if there is
                     it says somewhere USE_GEOS=1, then you can safely
                     use this.  If you have geos it is recommended to use
                     it, as its much faster for spatial queries.  In the
                     future we will auto detect it, but for now adding it
                     to info.xml files shall have to suffice. -->
