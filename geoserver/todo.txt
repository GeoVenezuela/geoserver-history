- in feature request and all others, find a method of 'executing' the
	request prior to any treatment of response.getOutputStream to gracefully
	catch exceptions and still be able of sending exception reports
	
- throw friendly exception if a request was made when the server
  did not finished starting up
- initialize datasores at startup time
- creo q no escribe los poligonos con anillos interiores
- manejar multiples queries (queries sobre multiples datasources)

- get transactions working again.
- revisit configuration files.
- getBounds working with postgis.
- roll the geotools files in the geoserver source tree back into geotools.
  (FeatureTransformer and FeatureResultsIteration
- roll web-inf hiding of configuration here (on 1.0.1 branch)
- locking.
- MaxFeatures working.
- test with resin 3
- get zserver working with resin.
- TEST, TEST, TEST! more unit tests in geoserver, full cite suite.

- error reporting for configuration should try to have reference to the file
  it is ready, for cases when user may be confused as to the location of the 
  file.
- roll geos in.  Auto-detect its presence.
- get user configured logging working again. 
- Not sure if each namespace should only be used for one datastore.  I would 
  like default namespace to be used for datastores that don't have a namepace
  defined.  But then we need some way to make sure that typeNames don't 
  collide.
- GetCapabilities should not choke if datastores are not enabled.
- Use IanS's new gml producer.
