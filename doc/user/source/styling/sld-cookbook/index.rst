SLD Cook Book
=============

The SLD Cook Book is a collection of SLD "recipes" for creating various types of map styles.  It is divided into four sections, the first three based on vector shapes (points, lines, and polygons) and the fourth section for rasters.  Each example contains an inline snippet of the code specific to the style, a screenshot showing actual GeoServer output, and a link to download the full SLD that created the output.

These examples use four data sets created especially for each section.
