Security and Making Changes
===========================

Logging In
----------

When first navigating to the Config menu, you will be asked to log in.  This security measure prevents unauthorized persons from making changes to GeoServer.  The default username and password is ``admin`` and ``geoserver``.  These can be changed only by editing the ``security/users.properties`` file in the :ref:`data_directory`.

Enter your username and password in the form, and click **Submit**.  You may also check the box that says **Remember my login on this computer** in order to prevent having to log in subsequently (although this setting is specific only to the computer, and will not globally affect security).
