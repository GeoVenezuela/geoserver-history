Installation
============

GeoServer is written in Java, and requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on a system in order to run.  The JDK is different from a Java Runtime Evnironment (JRE), which is what is most often installed on systems.  

The following pages explain how to install Java, and then to install GeoServer.  Specific instructions are also given for upgrading a pre-existing GeoServer instance.

If a Java JDK is already installed on the system you can jump ahead to the :ref:`geoserver_install` section. Otherwise continue on to the next section, :ref:`java_install`.
