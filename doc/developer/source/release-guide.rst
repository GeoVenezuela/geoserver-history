Upgrade branch pom versions
---------------------------

#. Upgrade branch pom version numbers::

     find . -name pom.xml -exec sed 's/<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT/<NEWVERSION>-SNAPSHOT/g' {} \;

Generate documentation from Confluence
--------------------------------------

#. Go to http://geoserver.org and log in.

Build release artifacts
-----------------------

.. warning::

   All operations for the remainder of this guide must be performed from the
   release tag.

#. Compile from the root of the source tree with the folling command::

     mvn clean install -P release

#. Build javadocs::

     mvn javadoc:javadoc

#. Build artifacts::

     mvn assembly:attached

At this point the release artifacts will be located in ``target/release``.

CITE test 
---------

#. Change directory to ``target/release`` and unzip the binary package::

     cd target/release
     unzip geoserver-*-bin.zip

#. Execute the GeoServer CITE tests as described in the :ref:`cite_test_guide`.

#. Unzip the war package and deploy the war in a servlet container such as
   Tomcat::

    unzip geoserver-*-war.zip
    cp geoserver.war /opt/tomcat5/webapps

#. Re-run GeoServer CITE tests.

Hand test
---------

Start GeoServer with the release data directory and hand test. A checklist of 
things to test can be found in the :ref:`release_testing_checklist`.

Build Windows installer
-----------------------

.. note:: 

   This step requires a windows machine.

#. If necessary download and install `NSIS <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page>`_.
#. Unzip the binary package.
#. Copy the files from ``release/installer/win`` to the root of the unpacked 
   archive.

   .. image:: win-installer1.png

#. Right-click on the installer script ``geoserver.nsi`` and select "Compile Script".  

   .. image:: win-installer2.png

After successfully compiling the script an installer named 
``geoserver-<VERSION>.exe`` will be located in the root of the unpacked archive.
 
Build Mac OS X installer
------------------------

.. note::

   This step requires a mac os machine.

Change directory to ``release/installer/mac`` and follow the instructions in 
``README.txt``.
