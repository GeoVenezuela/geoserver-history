Seeding and refreshing
======================

The primary benefit to GeoWebCache is that it allows for the acceleration of normal WMS tile request processing by eliminating the need for the tiles to be regenerated for every request.  That said, the tiles need to be generated at some point, and there are two ways for tiles to be generated.

Generating tiles
----------------

The first way for tiles to be generated is during **normal map viewing**.  In this case, tiles are cached only when they are requested, either through map browsing (such as in OpenLayers) or through manual WMS tile requests.  The first time a map view is requested it will be roughly at the same speed as a standard GeoServer WMS request.  The second and subsequent map viewings will be greatly accelerated as those tiles will have already been generated.  The main advantage to this method is that it requires no preprocessing, and that only the data that has been requested will be cached, thus potentially saving disk space as well.  The disadvantage to this method is that map viewing will be intermittently accelerated, reducing the quality of user experience.

The other way for tiles to be generated is by **seeding**.  Seeding is the process where map tiles are generated and cached automatically.  The advantage to this process is that the user experience is greatly enhanced, as by the time the user sees the map, it is already accelerated.  The disadvantage to this process is that seeding can be a very time- and disk-consuming process.

Seeding options
---------------

The :ref:`gwc_demo` contains a link next to each layer entitled **Seed this layer**. This link will trigger authentication with the GeoServer configuration.  Use the same username and password that you would use to log in to the :ref:`web_admin`.  (See :ref:`web_admin_config_intro` for more information.)  After a successful login, a new page shows up with seeding options.

.. warning:: Add screenshot for seeding options page

The seeding options page contains various parameters for configuring the way that the layer is seeded.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - **Option**
     - **Description**
   * - ``Number of threads to use``
     - Possible values are between **1** and **16**.
   * - ``Type of operation``
     - Sets the operation.  There are three possible values:  **Seed** (adds missing tiles, but does not overwrite existing ones), **Reseed** (like Seed, but overwrites existing tiles) and **Truncate** (deletes all tiles within the given parameters)
   * - ``SRS``
     - Specifies the projection to use when creating tiles (possible values are **EPSG:4326** and **EPSG:900913**)
   * - ``Format``
     - Sets the image format of the tiles.  Can be **application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml** (Google Earth KML), **image/gif** (GIF), **image/jpeg** (JPEG), **image/png** (24 bit PNG), and **image/png8** (8 bit PNG)
   * - ``Zoom start``
     - Sets the minimum zoom level.  Lower values indicate map views that are more zoomed out.  When seeding, GeoWebCache will only create tiles for those zoom levels inclusive of this value and ``Zoom stop``. 
   * - ``Zoom stop``
     - Sets the maximum zoom level.  Higher values indicate map views that are more zoomed in.  When seeding, GeoWebCache will only create tiles for those zoom levels inclusive of this value and ``Zoom start``.
   * - ``Bounding box``
     - *(optional)*  Allows seeding to occur over a specified area, instead of the full extent of the layer.  This is useful if your layer contains data over a large area, but the application will only request tiles from a certain area.  The four boxes correspond to **Xmin**, **Ymin**, **Xmax**, and **Ymax**.
   
When finished, click **Submit**.

.. warning:: Please be mindful when seeding your cache.  Currently there is no progress bar to inform you of the time required to perform the operation, nor is there any intelligent handling of disk space.  In short, the seed may take a *very* long time, and the cache may fill up your disk.

Manually deleting cached content
--------------------------------

If you have direct access to the file system on the server, you can also delete the appropriate layers in the cache directory (typically named ``gwc`` in the data directory, although this can be changed).  The structure of the cache directory is ``[root]`` > ``layer`` > ``projection_zoomlevel``.
