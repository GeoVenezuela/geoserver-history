Java
----

GeoServer requires Java to be installed on your system.  Oracle Java SE 6 or newer is strongly recommended, although Oracle JRE 5 will work.  A Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required to run GeoServer.  For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.
