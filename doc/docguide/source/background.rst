History
-------

GeoServer documentation has for a long time been hosted on geoserver.org.  This site has served two functions, as it is both the homepage for GeoServer itself and the documentation.  The site is a wiki, built using Confluence wiki software.

There were many advantages to having documentation as a wiki: there was a very low barrier to entry (anyone could sign up for an account and add/edit a page) and the homepage was already using the wiki software.  However, there were many disadvantages to this as well.  Confluence didn't allow for easy PDF output, pages didn't need to adhere to any obvious hierarchy, there was no version control, and the quality of documentation was inconsistent.

Thus, it was decided to break off the documentation from the wiki, and implement it with a new framework.  The way that was decided was Sphinx, a documentation generator built by the developers of Python.
