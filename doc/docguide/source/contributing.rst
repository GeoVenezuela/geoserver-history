How To Contribute
=================

There are many ways to contribute to GeoServer documentation.  The following are listed roughly in order of most involvement to least involvement.

Get commit rights
-----------------

The documentation is now under version control, just like the source code.  Also, like the source code, anyone can't just go editing it without first being granted commit rights.

.. warning:: Add instructions for getting commit rights

Once you have commit rights, please see the section on workflow for creating and editing the documentation.

File an issue with attached content
-----------------------------------

GeoServer uses JIRA for issue tracking.  New documentation is treated like part of the code, and so those who want to submit content (patches etc) without commit access can file an issue with JIRA and attach the content to the issue.  If the content is deemed satisfactory, someone with commit rights will add the content.

File an issue
-------------

If you don't want to write the documentation, or would like to suggest a page that isn't included, you can request it.  Use JIRA to submit an issue.  Mention the page, content, and the likely place where this new information should be included.  As with all issues, it is not guaranteed that someone will fulfill your request.
