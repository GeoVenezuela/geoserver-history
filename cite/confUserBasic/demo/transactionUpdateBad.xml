<!-- This is an example of a transaction that is caught by the validation  -->
<!-- processor, not allowing an insert of length zero.  This is defined in -->
<!-- validation directory, in FeatureCheck, which references plug-ins in   -->
<!-- plugIns directory.  You can define your own checks and even extend the-->
<!-- plugIns for more complex validation checks.  This will work even with -->
<!-- shapefiles, as the validation fails before the shapefile is affected. -->
