  Description:
    Abstract:
              The North Carolina Department of Environment, Health,
              and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Management,
              in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic Information
              and Analysis, developed the digital Water Supply Watersheds
              data to enhance planning, siting and impact analysis in
              areas directly affecting water supply intakes.
              This file outlines the extent of protected and critical
              areas and stream classifications for areas around water
              supply watersheds in which development directly affects a
              water supply intake.  This file enables users to identify
              the areas which have special restrictions for building and
              development based on water supply intakes. This file is
              updated as changes occur.
    Purpose:
              This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
              others in making resource management decisions through use
              of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

              Revisions and updates to this layer include:
              18.) filename: wsw496  The April 1, 1996 update:  A) The
              Upper Frech Broad River (Asheville) water supply watershed
              was moved from the proposed coverage to the adopted
              coverage.  B) The Mills River (Asheville) water supply
              watershed was moved from the proposed coverage to the
              adopted coverage.  C) The French Broad River water supply
              watershed was moved from the adopted coverage into the
              proposed coverage.  These edits affect Buncombe and
              Henderson Counties.
              17.) filename: wsw396  The March 6, 1996 update:  A) The
              Reedy Fork critical area was changed to 'WS-III NSW' to
              match the protected area.  This affected the Greensboro
              100k tile area.  B) The Belews Creek protected area was
              changed to 'WS-IV' to match the critical area.  This
              affected the Winston-Salem 100k tile area.
              16.) filename: wsw196  The January 25, 1996 update: A)
              Protected boundary was altered in the Long Creek (Little
              Tennessee) watershed.  The watershed name was renamed
              to be Rock Creek (Little Tennessee). This affected the
              Robbinsville 24k quad.  B) Protected boundary was altered
              in the South Fork Catawba River watershed.  This affected
              the Banoke 24k quad.  C) Addition of protected boundary
              for the Belews Creek watershed. This affected the Belews
              Creek 24k quad.  D) Watersheds were deleted by request of
              DEM-Tranters Creek which was on the Rocky Mount & Plymouth
              100k quads and Stokely Hollow which was on the Asheville
              100k quad.  E) Extensive changes to the actual boundaries
              of the watersheds throughout the state in an effort to
              have them coincident with the Hydrologic Units adopted
              earlier by EHNR-DEM and USDA-NRCS.  Boundaries coincident
              in both coverages were deleted from the watershed file and
              copied back from the hydrologic units file.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
              The NC DEHNR-DEM delineated the boundaries on 24k USGS
              paper topographic maps.  NCCGIA digitized these boundaries
              and attributed them with DEM classification information,
              river basin and stream names, and acres per polygon.  The
              digital files were plotted and overlayed to the originals
              and linework and label corrections were made. This digital
              file is updated as changes occur.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
          Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for
          arc and polygon topology using the "build" command.
          The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of
          1 foot.  Topology has not been edited since the last build
          or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
          These data represent the locations and identities of Water
          Supply Watersheds in North Carolina as mapped by the NCDEM.
          Each watershed is labeled with either a protected or critical
          area classification.  All boundaries are approved by DEM
          whether they are the original DEM boundaries or changes to
          original boundaries submitted for revision by local or county
          governments.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
                  Water supply watershed boundaries were marked on 7.5
                  Minute USGS paper topographic maps which meet National
                  Map Accuracy Standards, using a best estimate with
                  reference to surrounding features. Ridge lines were
                  interpolated from contours by cartographers and reviewed
                  by DEM staff.  Counties and municipalities have
                  restudied certain boundaries in detail for adjustment by
                  DEM. Boundaries drawn were digitized and check plots used
                  to ensure correct boundary location, within a line width.

                  Water supply watershed boundaries were delineated by
                  cartographers interpolating ridgelines on paper USGS 7.5
                  minute topographic maps. Boundaries were delineated around
                  known water supply intakes.  Intakes on streams or rivers
                  had critical areas delineated as ridgelines or half mile
                  buffers, whichever was closest, upstream of the intake
                  location.  Protected areas were delineated with ridgelines
                  or ten mile buffers, which ever was closer.  For intakes
                  on lakes and reservoirs, buffers were delineated from the
                  apparent pool elevation of the water body as shown on the
                  USGS quadrangle using the same limits as above. Boundaries
                  were reviewed by DEM staff.  After the linework was
                  digitized by NCCGIA (see below), DEM staff reviewed
                  the linework and attributes for accuracy. DEM supplies
                  CGIA with updates as they occur.

      Process_Description:
                  Water supply watersheds were digitized from hand
                  delineated water supply watershed boundaries on USGS 7.5
                  Minute series paper basemaps.  The digital files were
                  attributed and checkplots were created for review by the
                  Water Quality Section. Necessary corrections were made and
                  new plots were run. Post processing involved edgematching
                  and mapjoining of USGS 7.5 Minute series maps used to
                  create the digitized data.  This process generated one
                  statewide polygon coverage.  Boundaries of the watersheds
                  throughout the state, in an effort to have them coincident
                  with the Hydrologic Units adopted earlier by EHNR-DEM
                  and USDA-NRCS, were replaced with the hydrologic units
                  Boundaries for the watersheds.  Boundaries coincident in
                  both coverages were deleted from the watershed file and
                  copied back from the hydrologic units file.  CGIA updates
                  the digital file as needed.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
              A polygon coverage depicting areas classified by the
              Division of Environmental Management as having either
              protected or critical water supply watershed areas.  The
              polygon attribute table (PAT) has attribute data including
              total area in coverage units (square feet), total perimeter
              (linear feet), polygon internal identification number,
              polygon user identification number, a DEM internal index
              number that relates to the identification of the stream
              which runs through the watershed, the classification of the
              watershed, the river basin the watershed is contained in,
              the name of the stream which runs through the watershed, the
              classification date of the watershed, the DEM internal grid
              number that relates to the 7.5 minute USGS topographic map,
              the type of watershed -whether (P)roposed or (C)ritical, and
              the number of acres per polygon. There are no look up tables,
              annotation or cartosets for this data.
              A deductive estimate was used to determine the attribute
              accuracy value.  The value domains used are as follows:
              High - greater than 90% reliability;
              Medium - greater than 75% reliability;
              Low - less than 75% reliability.
