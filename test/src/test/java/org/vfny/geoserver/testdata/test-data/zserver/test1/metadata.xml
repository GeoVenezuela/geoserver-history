<abstract>
The North Carolina Department of Environment, Health,
and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Management,
in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic Information
and Analysis, developed the digital Water Supply Watersheds
data to enhance planning, siting and impact analysis in
areas directly affecting water supply intakes.
This file outlines the extent of protected and critical
areas and stream classifications for areas around water
supply watersheds in which development directly affects a
water supply intake.  This file enables users to identify
the areas which have special restrictions for building and
development based on water supply intakes. This file is
updated as changes occur.
</abstract>
<purpose>
This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
others in making resource management decisions through use
of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

Revisions and updates to this layer include:
18.) filename: wsw496  The April 1, 1996 update:  A) The
Upper Frech Broad River (Asheville) water supply watershed
was moved from the proposed coverage to the adopted
coverage.  B) The Mills River (Asheville) water supply
watershed was moved from the proposed coverage to the
adopted coverage.  C) The French Broad River water supply
watershed was moved from the adopted coverage into the
proposed coverage.  These edits affect Buncombe and
Henderson Counties.
17.) filename: wsw396  The March 6, 1996 update:  A) The
Reedy Fork critical area was changed to &apos;WS-III NSW&apos; to
match the protected area.  This affected the Greensboro
100k tile area.  B) The Belews Creek protected area was
changed to &apos;WS-IV&apos; to match the critical area.  This
affected the Winston-Salem 100k tile area.
16.) filename: wsw196  The January 25, 1996 update: A)
Protected boundary was altered in the Long Creek (Little
Tennessee) watershed.  The watershed name was renamed
to be Rock Creek (Little Tennessee). This affected the
Robbinsville 24k quad.  B) Protected boundary was altered
in the South Fork Catawba River watershed.  This affected
the Banoke 24k quad.  C) Addition of protected boundary
for the Belews Creek watershed. This affected the Belews
Creek 24k quad.  D) Watersheds were deleted by request of
DEM-Tranters Creek which was on the Rocky Mount &amp; Plymouth
100k quads and Stokely Hollow which was on the Asheville
100k quad.  E) Extensive changes to the actual boundaries
of the watersheds throughout the state in an effort to
have them coincident with the Hydrologic Units adopted
earlier by EHNR-DEM and USDA-NRCS.  Boundaries coincident
in both coverages were deleted from the watershed file and
copied back from the hydrologic units file.

The NC DEHNR-DEM delineated the boundaries on 24k USGS
paper topographic maps.  NCCGIA digitized these boundaries
and attributed them with DEM classification information,
river basin and stream names, and acres per polygon.  The
digital files were plotted and overlayed to the originals
and linework and label corrections were made. This digital
file is updated as changes occur.
</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>
Using ESRI&apos;s ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for
arc and polygon topology using the &quot;build&quot; command.
The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of
1 foot.  Topology has not been edited since the last build
or clean.

These data represent the locations and identities of Water
Supply Watersheds in North Carolina as mapped by the NCDEM.
Each watershed is labeled with either a protected or critical
area classification.  All boundaries are approved by DEM
whether they are the original DEM boundaries or changes to
original boundaries submitted for revision by local or county
governments.

Water supply watershed boundaries were marked on 7.5
Minute USGS paper topographic maps which meet National
Map Accuracy Standards, using a best estimate with
reference to surrounding features. Ridge lines were
interpolated from contours by cartographers and reviewed
by DEM staff.  Counties and municipalities have
restudied certain boundaries in detail for adjustment by
DEM. Boundaries drawn were digitized and check plots used
to ensure correct boundary location, within a line width.

Water supply watershed boundaries were delineated by
cartographers interpolating ridgelines on paper USGS 7.5
minute topographic maps. Boundaries were delineated around
known water supply intakes.  Intakes on streams or rivers
had critical areas delineated as ridgelines or half mile
buffers, whichever was closest, upstream of the intake
location.  Protected areas were delineated with ridgelines
or ten mile buffers, which ever was closer.  For intakes
on lakes and reservoirs, buffers were delineated from the
apparent pool elevation of the water body as shown on the
USGS quadrangle using the same limits as above. Boundaries
were reviewed by DEM staff.  After the linework was
digitized by NCCGIA (see below), DEM staff reviewed
the linework and attributes for accuracy. DEM supplies
CGIA with updates as they occur.

Water supply watersheds were digitized from hand
delineated water supply watershed boundaries on USGS 7.5
Minute series paper basemaps.  The digital files were
attributed and checkplots were created for review by the
Water Quality Section. Necessary corrections were made and
new plots were run. Post processing involved edgematching
and mapjoining of USGS 7.5 Minute series maps used to
create the digitized data.  This process generated one
statewide polygon coverage.  Boundaries of the watersheds
throughout the state, in an effort to have them coincident
with the Hydrologic Units adopted earlier by EHNR-DEM
and USDA-NRCS, were replaced with the hydrologic units
Boundaries for the watersheds.  Boundaries coincident in
both coverages were deleted from the watershed file and
copied back from the hydrologic units file.  CGIA updates
the digital file as needed.

<eaover>
A polygon coverage depicting areas classified by the
Division of Environmental Management as having either
protected or critical water supply watershed areas.  The
polygon attribute table (PAT) has attribute data including
total area in coverage units (square feet), total perimeter
(linear feet), polygon internal identification number,
polygon user identification number, a DEM internal index
number that relates to the identification of the stream
which runs through the watershed, the classification of the
watershed, the river basin the watershed is contained in,
the name of the stream which runs through the watershed, the
classification date of the watershed, the DEM internal grid
number that relates to the 7.5 minute USGS topographic map,
the type of watershed -whether (P)roposed or (C)ritical, and
the number of acres per polygon. There are no look up tables,
annotation or cartosets for this data.
A deductive estimate was used to determine the attribute
accuracy value.  The value domains used are as follows:
High - greater than 90% reliability;
Medium - greater than 75% reliability;
Low - less than 75% reliability.
