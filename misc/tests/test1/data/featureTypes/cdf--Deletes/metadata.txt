  Description:
    Abstract:
      TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the 
      U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau. 
      The 2002 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and 
      cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The
      TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of
      the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a
      projection.  The New York City rail data subset of the TIGER/Line 
      data was imported into a postgis database, and then used as a 
      backend for the GeoServer Web Feature Service.  All the rails of the
      five boroughs are included, returned as features in GML2.  The data
      can be queried using http post and get requests, as specified in the
      Open GIS Consortium's Web Feature Service specification. 
    Purpose:
      This dataset is used to demonstration the capabilties of GeoServer, 
      a Java j2ee implementation of the OGC's Web Feature Service (WFS).
      It also demonstrates the capabilities of the zserver module, which 
      provides an integrated z39.50 Geo Profile server, written in Java.  
      The TIGER/Line data that is provided by the U.S. Census Bureau
      in order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER 
      database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other 
      geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public 
      extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various 
      versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released on an irregular
      schedule since 1990; previous versions of the Census 2000 series 
      include the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, the UA 
      Census 2000 TIGER/Line files and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

    Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency:
      TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database when 
      needed for geographic programs required to support the census and 
      survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates 
      will be made to the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.  Future releases 
      of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER 
      database and will be released under a version numbering system 
      based on the month and year the data is extracted.

    None.  Acknowledgment of the U.S. Census Bureau would be appreciated 
    for products derived from these files.  TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census 
    TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a 
    trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.  
    The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together 
    running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The 
    Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures 
    which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and 
    cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational 
    Census TIGER database.
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), 
      FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes 
      and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been 
      examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) 
    is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong 
    to the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial 
    Data Transfer Standard" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are 
    topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain 
    relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
    requirements.  These requirements include:
    * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
    * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
    * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
    * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain 
    element and are consistent throughout the extract process.
    * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.
    The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical 
    consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.  
    The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update 
    System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census 
    TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for 
    states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding 
    spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for 
    logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original 
    Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided 
    to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining 
    FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been
    fully tested for consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the 
    Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (2002 version) 
    were created.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The information present in these files is provided for the purposes 
        of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates 
        in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but 
        the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as  
        the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies 
        with the source materials used, but generally the information is 
        no better than the established national map Accuracy standards 
        for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); 
        thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications 
        such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses 
        that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's 
        surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy 
        standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 
        1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of 
        most of the TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census 
        Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file 
        coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare 
        favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau 
        cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 
        1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The 
        Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators 
        annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER database as 
        they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 
        2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from 
        updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau 
        programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown 
        quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, 
        portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from 
        maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the 
        fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the 
        coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful 
        when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next 
        to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, 
        on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER 
        database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the 
        Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information 
        from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically 
        consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by 
        the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census 
        TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the 
        Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent 
        area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
        equivalent area is then distributed among 19 fixed length 
        record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either 
        line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census 
        Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
        since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature 
        and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate 
        updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous 
        version.
