<abstract>
TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the
U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.
The 2002 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and
cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The
TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of
the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a
projection.  The New York City road data subset of the TIGER/Line
data was imported into a postgis database, and then used as a
backend for the GeoServer Web Feature Service.  All the roads of the
five boroughs are included, returned as features in GML2.  The data
can be queried using http post and get requests, as specified in the
Open GIS Consortium&apos;s Web Feature Service specification.
</abstract>
<purpose>
This dataset is used to demonstration the capabilties of GeoServer,
a Java j2ee implementation of the OGC&apos;s Web Feature Service (WFS).
It also demonstrates the capabilities of the zserver module, which
provides an integrated z39.50 Geo Profile server, written in Java.
The TIGER/Line data that is provided by the U.S. Census Bureau
in order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other
geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public
extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various
versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released on an irregular
schedule since 1990; previous versions of the Census 2000 series
include the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, the UA
Census 2000 TIGER/Line files and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

<update>
TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database when
needed for geographic programs required to support the census and
survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates
will be made to the 2002 TIGER/Line files.  Future releases of
TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER
database and will be released under a version numbering system
based on the month and year the data is extracted.

TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.
The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together
running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The
Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures
which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and
cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational
Census TIGER database.

Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS),

examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.

<logic>
The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2)
is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong
to the &quot;Geometry and Topology&quot; (GT) class of objects in the &quot;Spatial
Data Transfer Standard&quot; (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are
topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
requirements.  These requirements include:
* Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
* Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
* Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
* Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain
element and are consistent throughout the extract process.
* The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.
The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical
consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.
The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update
System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census
TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for
states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding
spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for
logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original
Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided
to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining
FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been
fully tested for consistency.

Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the
Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (2002 version)
were created.

The information present in these files is provided for the purposes
of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates
in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but
the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies
with the source materials used, but generally the information is
no better than the established national map Accuracy standards
for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);
thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications
such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses
that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth&apos;s
surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy
standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,
1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of
most of the TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census
Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file
coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare
favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau
cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the
1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The
Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators
annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER database as
they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census
2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from
updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau
programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown
quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources,
portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from
maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the
fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the
coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful
when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next
to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position,
on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER
database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the
Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information
from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically
consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by
the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census
TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent
area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
equivalent area is then distributed among 19 fixed length
record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either
line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census
Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature
and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate
updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous
version.
