quickWMS Javascript classes for WMS clients 
Coding guidelines 
_________________________________________________________________________________

This is a working list of recommendations for writing the javascript
code in the quickWMS library. It should be mandatory but as you might
have seen even I have sometimes disregard it ... let's do our best to 
follow it. Any suggestions are welcomed : pedro@inovagis.org 
_________________________________________________________________________________

- All objects methods and properties are case sensitive and should 
  start with a lower case letter and when applicable, in the case 
  of composed names with two or more English words, the following 
  words should have the first character in upper case (known as 
  lowerCamelCase, e.g. startService or percentDone). 

- All changes should be commented and signed.

- All parameters functions calls and definitions should have a space 
  between the comma and parameter name or value 
  e.g. you should do 
          function myFunction(param1, param2, param3)
  and NOT 
          function myFunction(param1,param2,param3)
  the same thing when calling the function.
