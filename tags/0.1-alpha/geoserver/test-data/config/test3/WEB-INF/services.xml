Sets the global character set.  This could use some more testing
from international users, but what it does is sets the encoding
globally for all postgis database connections (the charset tag
in FeatureType), as well as specifying the encoding in the return
xml header and mime type.  The default is UTF-8.  Also be warned
that GeoServer does not check if the CharSet is valid before
attempting to use it, so it will fail miserably if a bad charset
is used.
