  <title>Introduction</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Welcome</title>

    <para>The GeoServer project is an integrated Java implementation of the
    1.0 Web Feature Server and 1.1.1 WMS specification from the <ulink
    url="http://www.opengis.org">OpenGIS</ulink> Consortium. GeoServer aspires
    to be the '<ulink url="http://www.apache.org">Apache</ulink>' of OpenGIS
    data serving and its mission is to enable greater geographic
    interoperability by reinforcing OpenGIS and other web standards and
    lowering the barriers to entry for geographic data providers. Developers
    should keep in mind the four primary goals of GeoServer, listed in order
    of importance:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Standards Compliance</emphasis>: The
        primary intent of the GeoServer project is to promote standardization
        and it must, therefore, adhere to published standards as closely as
        possible. GeoServer also attempts to support as many relevant
        geographic standards as possible.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Data Format Support</emphasis>: In order
        to make GeoServer a useful product, it must help translate the current
        cacaphony of geogaphic data formats into a single format. Therefore,
        supporting several data formats - both relational and flat files - is
        of primary importance to the project.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Ease of Use</emphasis>: GeoServer is
        targeted at organizations with minimal technical expertise and must,
        therefore, be easy to install, configure, and run for organizations
        with few technical resources.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Efficiency</emphasis>: Given that the
        volume of data required by geographic applications generally entails
        severe computational and bandwidth loads, GeoServer strives to be as
        efficient as possible, while achieving other goals.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The GeoServer Project strives to be as open as possible, making it
    easy for any one to join the community and contribute, be it with feature
    suggestions, bug reports, patches, documentation, encouragement, funding,
    development, design, translation, or more. We want GeoServer to be
    collaboratively built, so that it can effectively meet a variety of needs,
    hopefully leading to a world of more open technology and open spatial
    data. To that end much effort has been put into documentation, so that new
    developers can easily get their bearings. If there are questions that are
    not answered by this developer's guide, or other documentation on this
    site, please ask, it's the only way the developers can know what needs
    improvement. </para>

    <para>GeoServer has an active developer community that you can engage by
    joining the GeoServer mailing list and asking questions or making
    suggestions. </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Contributing</title>

    <para>The GeoServer Project believes strongly that the code for GeoServer
    should be open and available to all. The one thing that we do ask is that
    if you do find the software useful you try to find a way to give back.
    This can be as simple as suggesting a feature or improvement, reporting a
    problem, or letting others know about GeoServer. These may seem like very
    minor things, but commercial software companies pay large amounts of money
    for these things, but they call them Quality Assurance and Advertising.
    Every little thing helps to make GeoServer a better project, and while
    there are a few core developers, the software would not be nearly as
    advanced as it is today without a community of people testing, making
    suggestions and spreading the word. You can even help out by just offering
    words of encouragement to those working on the project, as many developers
    do not do this for the money, but just to feel proud about something
    they've worked on. Adding yourself to the <ulink
    url="http://www.moximedia.com:8080/imf-ows/imf.jsp?site=gs_users">user
    map</ulink> is a great way to let us know that you appreciate the work
    done.</para>

    <para>Beyond the simple ways of helping out there are a lot more ways to
    get involved. Writing code is the obvious one, but there are many tasks
    that those with different skills can help out on. The obvious one is
    documentation, a task most developers loathe. We have tried to lower the
    barrier to entry to write documentation, by starting the <ulink
    url="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/Home">GeoServer Wiki</ulink>.
    The site is editable by anyone, with an incrediblly simple mark up
    language that takes about 2 minutes to learn. Please add or modify any
    information there. It currently could use a nice re-organization, which we
    hope to start relatively soon. </para>

    <para>Another great way to help out is translation. We would like
    GeoServer available in as many languages as possible, as we want world
    wide data to be available to all. The first thing to translate is the web
    administration tool, which can be easily translated to most any language
    by making a new ApplicationsResources file. The second way is by
    translating the documentation. If you are interested in translation just
    email geoserver-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and we can get you started
    (and will update this document).</para>

    <para>Most of these developer docs are aimed directly at how developers
    can contribute. There are always tasks to be done, but we have found in
    the past that it's better to have a problem you would like to solve,
    rather than ask developers where you might help out. If you do want to
    just help out, it's best to have an idea of what kinds of tasks you are
    interested in. A good place to start to get a sense of what we are working
    on is our JIRA <ulink
    url="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311">task
    tracker</ulink>. Or just ask the developers list. We also highly encourage
    companies who would like to spend some of their developers resources on
    expanding GeoServer's capabilities. In return for major work we are more
    than happy to put links on the main GeoServer site pointing users to
    commercial support offered by any company that contributes. </para>

    <para>A final way to help out is if you are part of a large organization
    using GeoServer. You are more than welcome to use it, with no obligation
    at all, we work on it so it will be used. But the one thing we would like
    to say is that if there are some capabilities that GeoServer might be
    lacking compared to commercial software, it may be more cost effective to
    employ developers to work directly on the capability you need than to
    merely pay for the right to use some one else's software. Any improvements
    made on GeoServer go to the benefit of all, not just those who can afford
    expensive software. If there is concern over the quality of support
    available from an Open Source project please see the section on Commercial
    Support. And if your organization does not have developers we can easily
    find high quality developers to do the work desired. Support for GeoServer
    in the past has come from a variety of sources, from non-profits, to
    government agencies, commercial companies, consulting shops for large
    clients, and the free time of people who care.</para>

    <title>A note on the license</title>

    <para>GeoServer is curently released under the <ulink
    url="license.html">Gnu Public License (GPL)</ulink>. None of our core
    contributors are fanatic about the GPL, it just seemed to be the best
    choice at the time, and we have not changed it since. We would like to say
    that the GPL is not anti-business, as many opponents like to make it out
    to be. Selling GeoServer is completely legal, as is offering commercial
    support on it. What it does is protects the rights of developers, by
    ensuring that no one can take the base of code and improve it without
    giving it back to those who laid the ground work. The main reason we like
    it because it keeps the community tighter, lets us know who else is
    working on GeoServer. If for some reason you would like to develop
    GeoServer, but your company is scared of the GPL, then please talk to the
    developers, as we can often come up with a good solution, releasing it
    under a different license to your company, for example. We don't care
    about all code being rolled back in, as the GPL stipulates, but we would
    like to know who else is working on GeoServer. So far we do not think the
    GPL license has held anyone up, perhaps due to the fact that GeoServer is
    a seperate enough piece of software that it does not affect others so
    much. But please let us know if the license does concern you. We are
    considering Apache or LGPL for GeoServer 2.0, as we are looking to make it
    more of a framework on top of which other web applications could hang.
